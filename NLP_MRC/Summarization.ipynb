The union are contributing 60% of that contract and the regions are putting £1.3m in.\\n\"So it\\'s a total pot of just over £3m and if you look at the sorts of salaries that the... guys... have been tempted to go overseas for [are] significant amounts of money.\\n\"So if we were to bring the players back, we\\'d probably get five or six players.\\n\"And I\\'ve always felt - and this is with my rugby hat on now; this is not region or WRU - I\\'d rather spend that money on keeping players in Wales.\\n\"There are players coming out of contract, perhaps in the next year or so… you\\'re looking at your Liam Williams\\' of the world; Justin Tipuric for example - we need to keep these guys in Wales.\\n\"We actually want them there. They are the ones who are going to impress the young kids, for example.\\n\"They are the sort of heroes that our young kids want to emulate.\\n\"So I would start off [by saying] with the limited pot of money, we have to retain players in Wales.\\n\"Now, if that can be done and there\\'s some spare monies available at the end, yes, let\\'s look to bring players back.\\n\"But it\\'s a cruel world, isn\\'t it?\\n\"It\\'s fine to take the buck and go, but great if you can get them back as well, provided there\\'s enough money.\"\\nBritish and Irish Lions centre Roberts has insisted he will see out his Racing Metro contract.\\nHe and Phillips also earlier dismissed the idea of leaving Paris.\\nRoberts also admitted being hurt by comments in French Newspaper L\\'Equipe attributed to Racing Coach Laurent Labit questioning their effectiveness.\\nCentre Roberts and flanker Lydiate joined Racing ahead of the 2013-14 season while scrum-half Phillips moved there in December 2013 after being dismissed for disciplinary reasons by former club Bayonne.',\n",

What a beautiful world this will be, what a glorious time to be free.\"\\nSo sang Donald Fagen in the song I.G.Y. [International Geophysical Year] from his 1982 album, The Nightfly, evoking the technological optimism of his childhood in 1950s America.\\nIn 1957, the year the song is set, the USSR launched the world's first earth-orbiting satellite, Sputnik 1.\\nMankind seemed to be one step away from becoming Masters of the Universe.\\n\"People were looking at the pace of technological development and as we got into quantum physics it even seemed that the notion of teleportation was plausible,\" says Glenn Lyons, professor of transport and society at the University of the West of England.\\n\"There were certainly some leaps of faith.\"\\nSo why did so many of those wide-eyed visions for tomorrow's transport never come to pass?\\n\"The reason they didn't happen is the same reason why they won't happen in the future - technological utopianism,\" says Colin Divall, professor of railway studies at York University.\\n\"There's always a vested interested in overhyping new transport schemes, because inventors are looking for investment.\"\\nAnd there's the rub - money, or lack of it.\\nGeorge Bennie's Railplane - a suspended carriage driven by propellers fore and aft - made it to the prototype stage near Glasgow in 1930, but did not then get commercial backing. Bennie went bust in 1937.\\n\"Bennie's train did work as did other prototypes, such as the hovercraft on a track in the late 1960s, but they were never commercially viable,\" says Prof Divall.\\nRene Couzinet's elegant and intriguing Aerodyne RC-360 \"flying saucer\" failed to win government support and never got off the ground - literally.\\nConcorde, the elegant delta-winged supersonic passenger jet capable of 1,350mph (2,173kph), was noisy, polluting and pricey. It made its last flight in 2003.\\nSpace travel in particular has proved astronomically expensive - pun intended - which is why no-one has revisited the Moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.\\nNasa's 1972-2011 space shuttle programme cost nearly $200bn (Â£132bn) in total for 135 missions - or about $1.5bn per flight.\\nGravity, it seems, is a very tough nut to crack.\\nTomorrow's Transport is a series exploring innovation in all forms of mobility against a backdrop of global warming and rising population.\\nAlan Bond, founding director of Oxfordshire-based Reaction Engines, believes his company has developed a jet engine capable of powering a passenger plane at Mach 5 - five times the speed of sound - meaning a flight from London to Sydney would take under five hours.\\n\"But at the moment no-one has moved on that because it's going to be very expensive to develop - there has to be a strong commercial incentive,\" he says.\\nInnovation costs, and if the invention doesn't solve a pressing problem for the majority of people at a price they can afford, it's unlikely to take off.\\nIt also doesn't help if your futuristic transport project ends up killing people.\\nThe sinking of the \"unsinkable\" Titanic in 1912, with the loss of more than 1,500 lives, did little to increase the popularity of luxury ocean liners.\\nBut it did usher in a number of new maritime safety regulations and ultimately did little to halt the mid-20th Century boom in ocean travel.\\nHowever, when the majestic Hindenburg, the largest hydrogen-filled zeppelin ever made, caught fire and crashed to the ground in 1937, killing 36 people, the disaster effectively ended the use of airships as passenger transport.\\nAir travel in particular demanded stringent global safety standards to win public trust, leading to a conservatism in design and a cautious, iterative approach to technological development.\\nThe iconic Boeing 747 \"Jumbo Jet\", first flown commercially in 1970, looks almost identical to the 747s flying today, 45 years later.\\nSimilarly, motor cars of the early 20th Century were more distinctive and diverse than they are now, but the need for global safety standards saw a gradual homogenisation in design.\\nOf course, global warming caused by manmade greenhouse gases has imposed severe strictures on all future transport projects.\\nTransport contributes about 25% of global carbon dioxide emissions, yet the global population continues to rise along with demand for mobility.\\nCar technology may have come on in leaps and bounds, but our potholed roads are gridlocked and many megacities around the world are wreathed in lethal pollution.\\nOur wantonness with hydrocarbons has become self-destructive and cannot continue, argue many.\\nSo the race is on to switch to alternative low-carbon fuels - conventional electric batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, and compressed air to name a few.\\nThere is also a lot of work going on to make our existing vehicles more efficient - using more lightweight materials, for example - and making use of data analytics to improve how we operate and integrate our urban transport systems.\\nBut in the digital age, are we beginning to think differently about transport?\\n\"Our cities will increasingly function through the mass movement of information rather than the movement of vehicles,\" argues Prof Lyons.\\nOthers disagree, believing the human need to travel, explore and trade will always keep us on the move.\\nOver the coming weeks our Tomorrow's Transport series will be exploring how we are responding to these challenges and featuring forthcoming innovations in planes, trains and automobiles.</td>\n",
